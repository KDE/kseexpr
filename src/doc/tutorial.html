<h2>Programmer Tutorial</h2>

<p>
Getting started with SeExpr is relatively easy.  SeExpr gives you a way to
evaluate one or many evaluations of an expression. What changes between
different applications of expressions is mainly the particular variables that
are accessible (sometimes also the set of functions).  Each application of
expressions generally has it's own subclass of Expression that gets
instantiated.  To get started we're going to go through a simple application
that is an ascii graphing calculator. This is located in the
src/demos/asciiGraph.cpp part of the source tree.
<p>

<h2>Problem Overview</h2>

We are going to write a function grapher that displays in ASCII. In particular
for a given f(x) we can evaluate it at all the x's in a window and draw the
resulting y's.
For example if
the user ran our program
<pre>
./asciiGraph "val=.5*PI*x;7*sin(val)/val"
</pre>
we would get
<pre>
                              |                             
                              |                             
                             ###                            
                            # |#                            
                           ## |##                           
                           #  | #                           
                          ##  | ##                          
                          #   |  #                          
                         ##   |  ##                         
                         #    |   #                         
                         #    |   ##                        
             ####       #     |    #       ####

      ######      ##   #      |     #    #      ######      
                   ## ##      |     ## ##                   
                    ###       |      ###                    
                              |                             
                              |                             
                              |                             
</pre>
or if we did
<pre>
./asciiGraph "x-3"
</pre>
we'd get
<pre>

    ####                      |                             
####                          |                             
                              |                             

</pre>

<h2>Implement the subclass</h2>

First we subclass Expression and give it a constructor, typically one that
takes an expression string.
<pre>
class GrapherExpr:public KSeExpr::Expression
{
public:
    //! Constructor that takes the expression to parse
    GrapherExpr(const std::string& expr)
        :KSeExpr::Expression(expr)
    {}
...
};
</pre>

<h3>A simple variable reference</h3>
This is not a very interesting subclass of expression until we add some
additional variables.  Variables on some applications may be very dynamic. In
this case, however, we only need 'x', so we make a ExprVarRef  subclass

<pre>
class GrapherExpr:public KSeExpr::Expression
{
...
    //! Simple variable that just returns its internal value
    struct SimpleVar:public KSeExpr::ExprVarRef
    {
        SimpleVar() : KSeExpr::ExprVarRef(KSeExpr::ExprType().FP(1).Varying()), val(0.0) {}
        double val; // independent variable
        void eval(double* result) {result[0] = val;}
        void eval(const char** result) {}
    }
...
};
</pre>
Once we have this we need an instance to store our variable and provide a
reference to that. We make it mutable, because resolveVar() is const. One does
not need to store a variable reference in a given expression. In fact, it may be
useful to use the same ExprVarRef from multiple expressions!  For example, if
you have 10 expressions that all have access to the same variables, this is
an important optimization.
<pre>
class GrapherExpr:public KSeExpr::Expression
{
...
    mutable SimpleVar x;
...
};
</pre>
<h3>Binding our variable reference</h3>
If we now tried to use expressions, the variable would still not be found by our
expressions. To make it bindable we need to override the resolveVar() function
as follows:
<pre>
    //! resolve function that only supports one external variable 'x'
    KSeExpr::ExprVarRef* resolveVar(const std::string& name) const
    {
        if(name == "x") return &x;
        return 0;
    }
</pre>

<h3>Variable setting</h3>
Next we need to make a way of setting the variable. As the controlling code will
use the expression evaluation, it will repeatedly alternate between setting the
independent variables that are used and calling evaluate().  What it has to do
depends very much on the application. In this case we only need to set the
independent variable x as:
<pre>
class GrapherExpr:public KSeExpr::Expression
{
...
    void setX(double x_input)
    {x.val=x_input;}
...
};
</pre>

<h2>Evaluating expressions</h2>

Evaluating an expression is pretty easy. But before we can do that we need to
make an instance. 
<pre>
    GrapherExpr expr("x+x^2");
</pre>
However, there might be errors in the expression you must check with isValid()
before you can evaluate. Then you can print a parse error as well
<pre>
    if(!expr.isValid()){
        std::cerr"expression faield "&lt;&lt;expr.parseError()&lt;&lt;std::endl;
        exit(1);
    }
</pre>
Finally, we can loop through all the x points in the graph and find out the y
value as follows:


<pre>
   // evaluate the graph
    const int samplesPerPixel=10;
    const double one_over_samples_per_pixel=1./samplesPerPixel;
    for(int i=0;i&lt;w;i++){
        for(int sample=0;sample&lt;samplesPerPixel;sample++){
            // transform from device to logical coordinatex
            double dx=double(sample)*one_over_samples_per_pixel;
            double x=double(dx+i)/double(w)*(xmax-xmin)+xmin;
            // prep the expression engine for evaluation
            expr.setX(x);
            // evaluate and pull scalar value
            Vec3d val=expr.evaluate();
            double y=val[0];
            // transform from logical to device coordinate
            int j=(y-ymin)/(ymax-ymin)*h;
            // store to the buffer
            if(j&gt;=0 && j&lt;h)
                buffer[i+j*w]='#';
        }
    }    for(int i=0;i&lt;w;i++){
</pre>

<h2>Running the program</h2>

Usage is
<pre>
./asciiGraph <expression>
</pre>

Be sure to put the expressions in quotation marks i.e. Some fun examples.
<pre>
./asciiGraph 'x'
./asciiGraph 'x^2'
./asciiGraph '.1*x^3-2*x'
./asciiGraph 'fit(noise(.5*x),0,1,-10,10)'
./asciiGraph 'fit(smoothstep(x,-8,8),0,1,-9,9)'
</pre>
